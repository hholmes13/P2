This test was run with a threshold of 20 to show the PrintLogging aspects included in the program.
All tests written by Prof. Green have been passed.
When the temp rises above or below the specified setpoints the heater's state is switched appropriately and it is stated by the PrintLogger. 
Test P2 relies on the Clock class to pre-clock and clock the clockable objects. The fact that the clockable objects move forward in time together indicates that the clock is
running properly as well as the clockable objects.
